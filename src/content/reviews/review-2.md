The Lakehurst Bungalow exceeded all our expectations! The lake views are simply gorgeous, and we loved having our morning coffee on the deck. The house is beautifully maintained and decorated with such care. We explored the nearby wineries (highly recommend the Old Firehouse Winery!) and spent peaceful afternoons reading by the water. The hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful. This is our new favorite Lake Erie vacation spot, and we've already booked for next year!
