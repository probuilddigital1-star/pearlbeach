We rented the lakehouse for our annual family reunion, and it was perfect! With 13 of us, we had plenty of space and never felt cramped. The multiple bedrooms and bathrooms made it easy for everyone. The kids loved the beach access, and the adults appreciated the proximity to wineries. The fire pit was a huge hit for evening s'mores. Communication with the owners was excellent. Highly recommend for family groups!
