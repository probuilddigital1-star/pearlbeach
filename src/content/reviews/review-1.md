We had the most amazing week at the Pearl Beach Lakehouse! The sunsets were absolutely breathtaking - we spent every evening on the patio watching the sky change colors over the lake. The house was spotlessly clean, incredibly spacious, and had everything we needed. The kitchen was well-stocked, and we loved cooking meals together. Our kids had a blast exploring the beach and playing lawn games. The location is perfect - close to wineries for the adults and Geneva State Park for family activities. We can't wait to come back next summer!
